/**
 * The whitespace a document lays itself out with.
 *
 * A plain-text document is often columns of tabs, an indented heading and blank
 * spacer lines. HTML collapses all three, so the document read correctly in the
 * editor — which is `white-space: pre-wrap` — and came out flat everywhere it
 * is actually printed. The way back in was worse: Plate's deserializer collapses
 * whitespace with JavaScript's `\s`, which counts U+00A0, so every legacy
 * HTML from another editor indented with `&nbsp;` lost its alignment on open.
 *
 * See lib/whitespace.ts; the on-screen half is measured in
 * tests/browser/plain-text-paste.spec.ts.
