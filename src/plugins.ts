    // one, which is what a picture in a table cell is. Whatever is still
    // pointing at a `file:///` path once it has run is one of those, and its
    // bytes are in the RTF too. See lib/rtf-pictures.ts.

    // cleaner did not turn into tabs becomes one here, instead of a fixed run of
    // `&nbsp;`. One Word tab, one editor tab. See lib/word-tabs.ts.
    WordTabPlugin,
