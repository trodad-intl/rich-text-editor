/**
 * Whitespace that a document LAYS OUT with.
 *
 * A form-like document pasted as plain text does its whole layout with
 * horizontal whitespace — tabs to line the values up in a column, a run of
 * spaces to centre a heading, a blank line to open a gap:
 *
 *     Invoice No<TAB><TAB>:  INV-2026-0042
 *     Customer<TAB><TAB>:  Acme Trading Ltd
 *     <SPACE>
 *     <77 SPACES>SUMMARY
 *
 * HTML collapses every one of those to a single space (and drops it entirely at
 * the edges of a block), so the document came out of the serializer as
 * `<p>Invoice No\t\t: INV-2026-0042</p>` — right in the editor, which is
 * `white-space: pre-wrap`, and flattened everywhere the stored HTML is actually
 * read: a print page, a PDF, a customer-facing view. The columns closed up and
 * the blank line disappeared, because `<p> </p>` is an empty block.
 *
 * The reference for what should happen is not a guess. A plain contenteditable
 * editor does nothing at all with a plain-text paste — it bails out of its
 * paste handler when the clipboard carries no HTML ("plain-text paste -> let
 * the browser handle it") — so what such an editor produces IS Chrome's own
 * contenteditable paste, and that is measurable. It writes:
 *
 *     <div>Invoice No<span style="white-space:pre">\t\t</span>:&nbsp; INV-2026-0042</div>
 *     <div>&nbsp;</div>
 *     <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SUMMARY</div>
 *
 * Tabs preserved by a `white-space: pre` span, and every space run rebalanced
 * so that no two collapsible spaces ever sit next to each other. That is what
 * this module writes on the way out, and it is measured against the real thing
 * in tests/browser/plain-text-paste.spec.ts.
 *
 * The way IN needs the mirror of it. Plate's HTML deserializer implements CSS
 * whitespace collapsing itself (`collapseString` in @platejs/core), and its
 * regex is JavaScript's `\s`, which — unlike CSS — counts U+00A0 as collapsible.
 * So a non-breaking space arrives at the editor as a plain space, and a run of
 * them as ONE, and a leading run as nothing at all. Every legacy document
 * indented with `&nbsp;`, every Word paste whose tabs are `mso-tab-count`
 * spans full of them, and anything this serializer had just written, all lost
 * their alignment the moment they were opened. `protectWhitespace` puts those
 * runs inside a `white-space: pre` span before Plate sees them, which is the
 * one rule its collapser does honour.

 * untouched, so the two steps cannot interfere.
 *
 * A space is written as `&nbsp;` exactly when HTML would otherwise lose it:
 * when the previous character is a space that was kept as one, or when it sits
 * against the start or the end of the block, where a collapsible space is
 * dropped outright. Every other space stays a space — that is not tidiness, it
 * is the only place a line is allowed to WRAP, and a paragraph of prose whose
 * spaces were all made non-breaking would run off the side of the page.

 * of its block. A leaf that follows another one starts mid-line, where a space
 * is safe: `<strong>Status</strong> : Pending` must not gain an `&nbsp;`.
