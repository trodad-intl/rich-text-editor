/**
 * A picture the clipboard's HTML only NAMES, but whose bytes it also carries.
 *
 * Copying a picture in Word puts several things on the clipboard at once: HTML
 * that points at a file on the machine doing the copying
 * (`file:///C:/…/clip_image001.png`), the bytes in the RTF flavour, and — from
 * Windows itself — a plain image rendition of the selection.
 *
 * Plate reads the first two. It deliberately ignores the third for anything
 * that came from Word, and it is right to: what Windows renders is the WHOLE
 * SELECTION, so a header table copied with its QR code would come back as one
 * flat picture of the entire header, text and all, in place of the document.
 *
 * But when the selection was nothing BUT a picture, that rendition is the
 * picture, and it is the only copy of it left when the RTF is missing — which
 * is what happens with an image linked into the document rather than embedded,
 * or a clipboard that crossed a remote desktop. Today that paste inserts
 * NOTHING at all: the HTML names a file the browser may not read, and the bytes
 * sitting right there go unused.
 *
 * So: exactly one picture, that picture unreadable, no text anywhere, and
 * exactly one image on the clipboard. Anything less certain is left alone.
