/**
 * A PERCENTAGE line-height in a Word or LibreOffice clipboard, rewritten as the
 * CSS ratio it actually draws as in those applications.
 *
 * Both write proportional line spacing as a percentage — Word's "1.5 lines" and
 * LibreOffice's "Proportional 150%" both export `line-height:150%` — and both
 * mean it as a multiple of the FONT'S NATURAL LINE. A browser reads the same
 * declaration as a multiple of the FONT SIZE, which on Calibri is 17% tighter.
 * So a document typed at 1.5 lines opened here at what Word calls 1.23, and the
 * difference grew with every line of a table. See lib/line-gap.ts.
 *
 * Only percentages, and only from those two applications:
 *
 * - A percentage is what Word and LibreOffice write for proportional spacing,
 *   and a BARE ratio is what this editor's own serializer writes. Converting
 *   bare ratios too would multiply a document a second time every time somebody
 *   copied a table out of this editor and pasted it back.
 * - `normal` is left alone because it already agrees: it is the font's natural
 *   line in CSS, and that is exactly what "Single" means in both applications.
 * - An absolute leading (`line-height:12.0pt`, which Word writes for "Exactly"
 *   spacing beside `mso-line-height-rule:exactly`) is left alone because it is
 *   absolute in both models — there is no multiplier in it to correct.
