/**
 * A Word TEXT BOX, recovered from the clipboard.
 *
 * Insert → Text Box is how a document gets its title bar: a full-width box, a
 * fill behind it, coloured text inside. Copy that and the editor showed a
 * BROKEN IMAGE — no text, no colour, nothing to edit — and the reason is not
 * the editor's:
 *
 *   <p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape … fillcolor="#a8cdea"><v:textbox>
 *        <div><p><span style='color:red'>ANNUAL SUMMARY</span></p></div>
 *      </v:textbox></v:shape><![endif]-->
 *      <![if !vml]><img src="file:///C:/…/clip_image001.png"><![endif]></p>
 *
 * The text and the fill are inside an HTML COMMENT — Word's conditional
 * comment for IE's VML renderer — so no browser parses them and no pass over
 * the DOM can see them. What every other browser is left with is the second
 * branch: a PICTURE of the box, at a `file:///` path on the machine it was
 * copied from, which nothing on a web page is allowed to load. Hence the empty
 * frame. Plain contenteditable editors have exactly the same hole.
 *
 * So the comment is opened and read. The box becomes what it looks like — its
 * paragraphs, each laid on the shape's fill, which the editor draws as a
 * full-width band (components/block-background-plugin.ts) — and the picture
 * fallback is dropped so the document does not carry both.
 *
 * A box Word DREW A LINE AROUND becomes a one-cell table instead, because a
 * paragraph cannot carry an outline and a table cell carries all three — the
 * line, the fill and the inset — with machinery this editor already has. Which
 * of the two a box gets is decided by the box itself: only an outline it
 * actually states earns the table, so a fill-only box stays the plain band it
 * looks like.
