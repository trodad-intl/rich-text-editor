/**
 * The font size a BLOCK is set in — which is what decides how tall its line is.
 *
 * Every line box carries a STRUT: an invisible inline box in the block's own
 * font. So a paragraph's height is not set by the text in it but by the size
 * the BLOCK is, and here that was always the editable's base — `text-[18px]`
 * on the `document` variant. A row of 10px text and a row of 15px text came out
 * the same height, both taller than the document, because in each of them the
 * strut was the tallest thing on the line. Measured against a browser rendering
 * the same markup: 24px / 18px / 15px / 10px text gave rows of 44 / 38 / 34 /
 * 28px there and 49 / 40 / 40 / 40px here.
 *
 * So a block is given the size its own runs agree on, and an empty one the size
 * in effect around it. Written onto the node, drawn by FontSizePlugin's
 * injection, and emitted by `blockStyle` — a print stylesheet may state
 * `body p {font-size: 15px}`, which an inline size outranks, so the page and
 * the screen stay the same shape.
 *
 * The blank-line half of this came first and is the same idea: an empty block
 * has no run to measure at all.
 *
 * A blank line takes the size IN EFFECT on it: the one it carries itself, else
 * the size of the line above, else of the line below. It carries one of its own
 * more often than it looks — Enter splits the run you were typing in, so the
 * new empty leaf keeps its size — and the line above covers the rest: legacy
 * HTML's `<p><br></p>` states nothing at all.
 *
 * A block whose runs DISAGREE, or any one of which states no size, keeps the
 * editor's base: there is no single size to speak of, and the base is the
 * honest answer.
 *
 * Widening this from blank lines to every paragraph was asked for by name on
 * 2026-09-02, after the row-height question ("small text hole margin ta akoi
 * thakbe na text er opor dynamic hobe?"). It had been built once before across
 * the whole document and reverted; this time it was chosen deliberately, over
 * the narrower table-only option.

 *
 * A run of pure WHITESPACE that states no size is skipped along with the empty

 * its own — `<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>` — and puts no
 * size on it, so an indented line looked like a paragraph whose runs disagreed
 * and fell back to the editor's base while its unindented neighbours did not:
 * in a three-signature footer the first column's lines stood 24px against the
 * other two columns' 20px, and its indentation was drawn in 18px spaces instead
 * of the document's. A space shows nothing and says nothing; it takes the size
 * of the line it sits on, exactly as it does in a browser.
