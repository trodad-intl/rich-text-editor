/**
 * A box Word draws with Borders & Shading rather than with a text box.
 *
 * It is the other half of lib/word-textbox.ts, and from the reader's side the
 * same thing: a heading in a box at the top of a document. Word writes it as a
 * DIV around the paragraph, marked as its own:
 *
 *   <div style='border:solid #2E74B5 1.0pt; padding:1.0pt 4.0pt;
 *               background:#DEEAF6; mso-element:para-border-div'>
 *     <p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'>QUARTERLY SUMMARY</p></div>
 *
 * Plate drops the div and everything on it, so the box vanished and — worse —
 * its fill did not: a background on a div reaches the RUNS inside it, so the
 * heading came back as highlighted TEXT sitting where a box used to be.
 *
 * LibreOffice states the same box on the paragraph itself (`<p style='border:
 * 1pt solid #2e74b5'>`), which is what an uploaded .doc or .docx brings, so
 * both spellings are read here.
