 * A font size the document states on a BLOCK, restated on the runs inside it.
 *
 * `font-size` inherits in CSS, so `<td style="font-size:12px"><p>Approved</p>`
 * renders at 12px in every browser and in the printed document. A Plate node
 * cannot say that: only a text LEAF carries a size, and the deserializer drops
 * a block's outright. So the run arrived carrying nothing, fell back to the
 * editable's 18px base, and a document's body text came out BIGGER on screen than
 * in the document it was copied from — while its header, which states its size
 * on the span, came out right. That is what makes the mismatch look arbitrary.
 *
 * Worse on the way out: the serializer writes no block font-size either, so
 * opening a stored document that stated one and saving it wrote the size out of
 * the stored HTML for good.
 *
 * Only Word's own clipboard escaped, and only partly: `cleanDocx` copies a
 * paragraph's marks onto its span children. Nothing covers a size on the
 * `<table>`, and nothing at all covers HTML that is not Word's — Word Online,
 * Google Docs, another web page, or the LibreOffice conversion behind the
 * Word-import button.
 *
 * The walk itself lives in lib/inherited-style.ts, which `lib/inherited-color.ts`
 * shares; what is left here is the part that is about SIZES — including the two
 * spellings of a size that are not CSS at all: `<font size=N>` and Word's
 * `mso-ansi-font-size`.
