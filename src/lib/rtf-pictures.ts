/**
 * The pictures Word ships in the clipboard's RTF, matched to the HTML by ORDER.
 *
 * Word's clipboard HTML never carries a picture. It names one by a path on the
 * machine doing the copying — `file:///C:/…/clip_image001.png` — and puts the
 * bytes in the RTF flavour beside it. Plate reads that flavour already, but
 * only for a FLOATING picture: it matches an `<img>` to its bytes through
 * `v:shapes` → `o:spid` → `shplid`, and an INLINE picture, which is what a
 * picture dropped into a table cell is, has none of those. Word writes it as a
 * plain `<img id="Picture_x0020_1" src="file:///…">` and its bytes as a bare
 * `{\pict}` group.
 *
 * So the QR code in a document header came through as an empty frame while
 * LibreOffice, reading the same clipboard, showed it — the bytes were there the
 * whole time, unmatched.
 *
 * Matching is by document order, which is what Word guarantees and what every
 * RTF→HTML converter relies on: the Nth picture in the RTF is the Nth picture
 * in the document. To keep that honest this only acts when the two sides agree
 * exactly — every picture still unresolved, against every picture the RTF
 * holds. One more or one fewer and nothing is touched, because a picture in the
 * wrong place is worse than a picture that did not arrive.
