 * The one walk behind every "restate an inherited style on the runs" pass.
 *
 * `font-size` and `color` both INHERIT in CSS, so `<td style="color:#c00000">
 * <p>Overdue</p>` is red in every browser and in the printed document. A Plate
 * node cannot say that: only a text LEAF carries either mark, and the
 * deserializer drops the declaration outright from any element that maps to a
 * Plate element — a `<p>`, `<td>`, `<li>`, a heading. So the run arrives
 * carrying nothing.
 *
 * And it is worse on the way out than on screen: the serializer writes neither
 * a block font-size nor a block colour, so opening a stored document that stated
 * one and saving it wrote the value out of the stored HTML FOR GOOD.
 *
 * Same shape as `lib/legacy-alignment.ts`, and for the same reason: a value
 * that inherits has to be pushed onto the nodes that can actually hold it,
 * before Plate sees the HTML. Only the property differs between the two passes,
 * so only the property is a parameter — see `lib/inherited-font-size.ts` and
 * `lib/inherited-color.ts` for the ends of the walk that do differ.
