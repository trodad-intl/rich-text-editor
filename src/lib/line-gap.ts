/**
 * A LINE GAP, the way Word and LibreOffice mean it.
 *
 * The two models do not agree, and that is the whole of this file. Word's
 * "Multiple N" and LibreOffice's "Proportional N%" multiply the FONT'S NATURAL
 * LINE HEIGHT — what the font's own metrics say a line of it is. CSS
 * `line-height: N` multiplies the FONT SIZE. They coincide only for a font
 * whose natural line is exactly 1em, which no text font is.
 *
 * Measured in Chrome at 15px: Calibri's natural line is 1.2, so Word draws a
 * gap of 1 at 18px, 1.2 at 21.6px and 1.5 at 27px, where this editor drew
 * 15 / 18 / 22.5px — 17% tight at every step, and more on a font with a taller
 * natural line (the editor's own UI stack is 1.333, so 25%).
 *
 *     css ratio = gap x natural(font)
 *
 * WHY THE NATURAL LINE IS MEASURED AND NOT TABULATED. It is a property of the
 * font FILE, so it is only right if the font is actually installed: on a Linux
 * box without Word's fonts, Chrome substitutes and reports 1.15 for Arial,
 * Times, Verdana, Georgia and eighteen others alike — one substitute's metric
 * wearing every name. A table built from that would be fiction, and a table of
 * hand-copied metrics would be worse: unverifiable, and wrong the day a font is
 * updated. The editor and a print view both run in the same browser on the
 * same machine as Word does, so asking that browser is asking the same font
 * Word asked.
 *
 * The answer is baked into the saved HTML as a plain ratio, so the printed
 * page needs no measuring and no script — and a ratio resolves against the
 * element's own font SIZE, never its family, so it cannot drift afterwards.

/**
 * What a line is worth where nothing can be measured.
 *
 * jsdom does no layout, so every rect is zero there and the unit tests would
 * otherwise divide by it. 1.2 is Calibri's, the font most Word documents are written
 * in. A browser never reaches this.
