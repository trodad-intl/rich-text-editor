/**
 * A text colour the document states on a BLOCK — or in the pre-CSS spelling —
 * restated on the runs inside it.
 *
 * The same hole `lib/inherited-font-size.ts` fills, one property over, and it
 * costs a document more: a colour is the whole point of the run that carries it.
 * `color` inherits, so `<td style="color:#c00000"><p>OVERDUE</p>` is red
 * everywhere HTML is drawn — but Plate reads a colour onto a LEAF only, and
 * drops the declaration from every element that maps to a Plate element. So a
 * pasted `<p style="color:red">`, a red `<td>`, a coloured `<ul>` and a
 * `<div>`-wrapped warning line all arrived BLACK, and the first save
 * wrote the colour out of the stored HTML for good.
 *
 * Word's own clipboard was the one thing that mostly worked, because `cleanDocx`
 * copies a paragraph's marks onto its span children. Everything else lost it:
 * Google Docs, Word Online, another web page, a template pasted from a
 * browser, and the LibreOffice conversion behind the Word-import button — which
 * states colour the pre-CSS way, `<font color=...>`, on nearly every run it
 * writes.
