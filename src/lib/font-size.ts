/**
 * The scale this editor measures type on: POINTS, the same scale Word and
 * LibreOffice measure it on.
 *
 * Reported by name: "currently main doc has font size 10 but after paste our
 * editor show 13". Both numbers described the same text. Word states type in
 * points and the editor used to convert every pasted size into whole CSS
 * pixels, so 10pt arrived as `13px` — the control then named it 13, and 13px is
 * not even 10pt: 10pt is 13.333px, so the text was also drawn 2.5% small.
 *
 * Two things follow from that, and they are the whole of this module.
 *
 * **A document's own absolute unit is kept.** `10.0pt` stays `10pt`, so nothing
 * is rounded on the way in and the browser resolves it exactly as Word does —
 * 72 points to the inch, 96 CSS pixels to the same inch. Points are CSS, so the
 * node, the saved HTML and the printed page all carry them with no conversion
 * anywhere between; this is the same shape as the line-gap rule in
 * lib/line-gap.ts, where everything in the middle speaks CSS and only the edges
 * convert. Legacy HTML stating `15px` is likewise left in px — it renders
 * as it always did, and open + save does not rewrite it.
 *
 * **Everything the control says is in points.** A size is NAMED in points
 * whatever unit it is stated in, so one document cannot show two scales: a
 * pasted `10pt` reads 10 and a legacy `15px` reads 11.25, which is what 15px is.
 * Setting a size writes points.
 *
 * A relative size (`em`, `rem`, `%`) has lost the context it was a multiple of
 * by the time a run reaches this editor, so it is resolved against the size the
 * run will actually be drawn at and becomes points like any other foreign unit.
