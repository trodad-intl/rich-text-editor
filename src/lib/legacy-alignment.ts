/**
 * Alignment that predates CSS.
 *
 * A paragraph can say it is centred in two ways, and Word uses both:
 *
 *   <p align=center style='text-align:center'>   the modern pair
 *   <p align=center>                             the attribute alone
 *
 * Only the CSS half is ever read — TextAlignPlugin is configured with
 * `styleKey: "textAlign"`, so it looks at the style and nothing else. A
 * document that states alignment the old way therefore pastes flush left, which
 * is what happened to a centred "SUMMARY" heading and the rule of dashes
 * above it. LibreOffice, which converts the legacy `.doc` uploads on the server,
 * writes the attribute form constantly; so does anything old enough to emit
 * `<center>`.
 *
 * Rewriting those into an inline `text-align` before the HTML is deserialized
 * means one representation reaches the editor, and everything downstream —
 * which already handles the CSS correctly — needs no special case.
