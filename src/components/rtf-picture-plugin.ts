/**
 * Put the pictures the clipboard's RTF carries where its HTML only named them.
 *
 * FIRST in the plugin list, which makes it LAST to run — deliberately after
 * Plate's own docx cleaner. That one resolves a FLOATING picture through
 * `v:shapes` → `o:spid` → `shplid`; whatever is still pointing at a `file:///`
 * path afterwards is an INLINE picture, which has none of those and which the
 * cleaner cannot match. Running in this order also keeps the count honest: the
 * pictures already resolved are no longer waiting for one.
 *
 * See lib/rtf-pictures.ts.
