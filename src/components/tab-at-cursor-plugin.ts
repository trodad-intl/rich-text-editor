/**
 * Tab puts a tab in AT THE CARET, rather than indenting the whole line.
 *
 * `@platejs/indent` overrides `editor.tf.tab` to move the BLOCK: it sets
 * `indent` on the paragraph, which the serializer writes as `margin-left:
 * indent * 40px`. So the caret's position made no difference — a Tab pressed in
 * the middle of `Total amount due` moved the whole line 40px right and left
 * the text untouched, which is not what a tab is for in a document. Documents
 * are full of lines that line a value up with a tab stop part-way along, and
 * typing one was impossible.
 *
 * What is DELIBERATELY left alone:
 *  - Shift+Tab (`options.reverse`), so outdenting a block still works and a
 *    document pasted from Word with real indentation can still be flattened.
 *  - A list item, where Tab nests the item under the one above it. That is what
 *    Tab means in every editor and nobody asked for it back.
 *  - An EXPANDED selection, which still indents the block. Inserting there would
 *    do what typing any other character does — replace the selected text — and
 *    Tab is not a character anyone means to type over a selection. It also
 *    leaves a way to indent a block from the keyboard.
 * All three fall through to the override chain — the list plugin's `tab`, then
 * the indent plugin's — so those keep whatever behaviour they shipped with.
 *
 * Registered AFTER IndentKit in `plugins.ts`, which is what puts this override
 * outermost: `overrideEditor` wraps what is already there, so the plugin that
 * registers last is the one that decides first.
 *
 * The inserted character is a real `\t`. It survives the round trip — the
 * serializer wraps it in `white-space: pre` (see lib/whitespace.ts) and the
 * editable carries `[tab-size:0.5in]`, Word's default stop and the one print
 * stylesheets state too — so what is typed here is what prints.
