/**
 * Paste the picture the clipboard is carrying when its HTML only names one.
 *
 * A PASTE HANDLER rather than an `insertData` override, because that is where
 * the decision is actually made. Plate's own placeholder plugin inserts a
 * pasted image file only when the clipboard carries NO html:
 *
 *   if (files.length > 0 && !types.includes('text/html')) …
 *
 * — which is the right rule almost always, and the reason a screenshot pastes
 * as a picture while a copied web page pastes as a page. Word's clipboard trips
 * it: there IS html, so the files are ignored, and the html turns out to name a
 * picture at a `file:///` path the browser may not read. Nothing is inserted at
 * all — the bytes were on the clipboard the whole time.
 *
 * So this handles exactly the paste that would otherwise insert nothing: one
 * unreadable picture, no text, one image file. Everything else falls straight
 * through to the rule above. See lib/clipboard-picture.ts for why the case is
 * drawn that narrowly — a selection with text in it renders as a picture of the
 * WHOLE selection, which is not the document.
