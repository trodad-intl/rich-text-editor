/**
 * Guarantee every table node carries `colSizes`.
 *
 * Column resizing is entirely gated on it. `getTableCellSize` computes a cell's
 * width as `(colSizes ?? []).slice(col, col + colSpan).reduce(...)`, so with no
 * colSizes the width is 0 and TableCellElement falls back to its constant
 * `minWidth: 120 / maxWidth: 240`. Dragging a column border then writes an
 * override that nothing reads — the handle moves, the column does not. The
 * insert/delete-column transforms are guarded by `if (colSizes)` for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * Plate only populates colSizes when a table is created with `initialTableWidth`
 * set. Anything that arrives another way — pasted from Word, deserialized from
 * HTML saved by another editor — has none, which is every table in this editor.
 *
 * So any table without usable colSizes gets evenly distributed columns here.
 * That matches what it already rendered as, and makes the border draggable.

/**
 * Columns in the grid — over EVERY row, with both spans taken into account.
 *
 * Counting the first row alone is how a ragged table lost its extra columns. A
 * form-like table is often ten `label : value` rows with two of them broken into
 * five cells for a measurement pair; the first row says three, colSizes came
 * out three long, and the two columns that exist only in those rows had no
 * entry — so `getTableCellSize` summed them to 0, the cells fell back to the
 * constant min/max width, and dragging their border moved the handle and
 * nothing else. The three columns every row shared resized normally, which is
 * what made it look like a resize bug rather than a missing column.
 *
 * A rowSpan pushes the row below it along, so the grid is walked with an
 * occupancy map rather than by cell index — the same reading the print helper
 * `fitTablesToPage` needs, and for the same reason.
