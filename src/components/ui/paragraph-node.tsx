   * `extractDocumentSpacing`): that one is spaced by the document INSTEAD of by
   * the editor, so it drops `py-1` as well. Every other paragraph outside a
   * table is untouched, and `m-0` below still decides it. An inline style
   * outranks the class, which is what lets a row be as deep as the document
   * set it.

      // are all important — so `.m-0` beat the inline style and the row stayed
      // flat with the right margins written on it. The scoped preflight still
      // zeroes every margin, so nothing is left to a browser default.
      //
      // An INDENT is the same trap on the other axis, and it was missed. Plate's
      // IndentPlugin states the level as an inline `margin-left`, so `.m-0` beat
      // that too and an indented paragraph drew FLAT — while the serializer wrote
      // `margin-left: indent * 40px` all along, so the document saved and printed
      // with an indentation the author was never shown. Measured before the fix:
      // three paragraphs at levels 1/2/3 all computed `margin-left: 0px`.
      //
      // `my-0 me-0` rather than dropping the class outright: this editor loads
      // Bootstrap, whose `p { margin-bottom: 1rem }` is UNLAYERED and so beats the
      // scoped preflight at any specificity — leaving an indented paragraph with a
      // 16px gap under it that the printed document does not have. Both of those are
      // Bootstrap utility names as well, so both come out `!important` and win,
      // and neither says anything about `margin-left`.
      // `py-1` is dropped rather than overridden for the same reason `m-0` is.
