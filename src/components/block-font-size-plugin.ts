 * Give every paragraph the size its own text is set in, and take it away again
 * from any that has no single size to speak of.
 *
 * The size goes on the BLOCK because that is what a line box is measured
 * against: every line carries a STRUT in the block's own font, so a paragraph
 * of 10px text sitting on the editable's 18px base is 18px tall however small
 * its text is. FontSizePlugin injects `fontSize` into paragraphs (see
 * components/font-kit.tsx), so writing it here draws it, and `blockStyle`
 * writes the same value into the saved HTML — where it outranks the print
 * page's own `body p {font-size: 15px}`, keeping the page and the screen the
 * same shape.
 *
 * `editor.children` is re-read each turn because `setNodes` replaces the node,
 * and consecutive blank lines take their size from the one above.
