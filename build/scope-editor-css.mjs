/**
 * Re-roots the editor's stylesheet under `.rte-scope`.
 *
 * The editor imports Tailwind WHOLE, preflight included, because Plate's node
 * components are written against that baseline. A host app it is mounted
 * into may be a Bootstrap 5 app with hundreds of screens, and an unscoped
 * preflight would flatten every heading, list, table and form control on all of
 * them. These transforms run on the BUILT css (see build/build-css.mjs), after
 * Tailwind has generated its utilities, so there is
 * nothing left to generate that could escape afterwards.
 *
 * Three things happen here, and the third is the unobvious one:
 *
 *   1. `scopeEditorCss` prefixes every selector with `.rte-scope`.
 *   2. It marks a rule's declarations `!important` when the rule's own class
 *      name also names a Bootstrap utility that Bootstrap declares
 *      `!important` — `.p-0`, `.mb-1`, `.py-1` and ~54 others. Specificity
 *      cannot beat an `!important` declaration, so matching it is the only way
 *      the editor's version of a colliding name wins. (An important LAYERED
 *      declaration does beat an important unlayered one: layer order is
 *      reversed for important declarations, and Tailwind emits inside
 *      `@layer`.)
 *   3. `bootstrapNeutralizerCss` handles the other half of a name collision:
 *      the properties Bootstrap states for that class and the editor does NOT.
 *      Those are unlayered NORMAL declarations, which beat a layered one at any
 *      specificity, so they reach inside the editor untouched. `.table` is the
 *      case that forced this — Tailwind's `.table` is only `display: table`, so
 *      there was no editor declaration for `width` to override Bootstrap's
 *      `width: 100%` with, and a table could not be resized below full width.
 *
 * Element defaults are deliberately NOT neutralised. For every property
 * Bootstrap's reboot states for an element, Bootstrap is what the editor shows
 * — a heading is reboot's 500-weight one, a list is indented reboot's 2rem.
 * That is the contract src/styles/content.css (`.rte-content`) mirrors for
 * read-only and print rendering, and `tests/browser/print-parity.spec.ts`
 * measures both sides against it.
 *
 * Guarded by tests/unit/editor-css.test.ts, which reads the built css back.
